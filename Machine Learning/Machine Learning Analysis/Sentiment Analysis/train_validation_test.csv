ChIJdxtvuPsFeS4Rv8ET0W7Xc0Y,"hello lore management, I am very disappointed with the service system at lore. why are the lore workers so unfriendly and take their own way with visitors? I visited Trenggalek, tried to break fast together at this cafe and hoped to visit this cafe more because many people recommended this cafe lore. I went here on April 19 2023. I waited for about 40 minutes to eat iftar, and when I asked the cashier, it turned out it hadnt been made yet. I really dont know how a fairly large cafe could do something so fatal. This is my first time at Cafe Trenggalek and this is a very bad impression. At least if youve made a mistake, why cant you come to my desk and just apologize. even though I paid, I didnt ask. When complained, the waiter was rude and didnt accept input. Please the management immediately correct this kind of attitude, because it is very inappropriate in the eyes of customers. I often go to cafes all my life, which in Jakarta has never had a problem like this, in fact the staff there are friendlier to customers. but the staff here are not very welcoming and unfriendly when given criticism and suggestions.

ChIJoYHRcAj0aS4RVQWV6AABM8s,"I dont have any comment on Food and Beverage, theyre good and tasty. But I think Anomali coffee has issue with their delivery service or order-taking service in general. It happens twice already, we ordered in bundle, 6 cups of coffee and 7 pastries, we received: 6 cups and 6 pastries, minus 1 pastry. The other day, they missed 1 cup of coffee but complete pastries. It is so annoying that we have to make a phone call, confirmed it to the restaurant, and waiting for the restaurant to send the replacement! THIS SHOULD NEVER EVER HAPPENED as it wasted so much time to both parties. I feel this is unacceptable. The price is relatively pricey, customer like me expect the best service. We do not want to know if theres short-staffed or anything like that. Anomali misses our order PRETTY OFTEN!, so I conclude, they cannot take large order.. So, for the other customers.. if you only want to have a cup or two, go for it. Anomali Coffee tastes good, pastry tastes amazing.. but if you are with group of friends more than 5, ordering via online (delivery) please consider the other restaurant, it is so not worth it if they miss our order just what happened to me SO MANY TIMES.",1,"{""latitude"": -6.2152394, ""longitude"": 106.83005569999999}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

It was wrong, no one apologized, instead he insisted on saying there was no seafood, just pork even though he had shown shrimp in front of his face. If my family eats dishes that contain seafood, if the allergy recurs and they end up in the hospital for anaphylaxis, will this restaurant take responsibility??????? Please improve employee ethics.

Came at 4 pm, Tuesday, there were only 2 visitors, then when they finished I was alone until 7 oclock. This time I ordered Sambosa, Stir-fried Acehnese Noodles, Hot Lemongrass Tea, Shaved Cucumber Ice. All delicious. The original lemongrass tea is made from lemongrass soaked in water, not powder. Shaved Cucumber Ice tastes just right, not too sweet. Fresh! Sambosa is delicious, 3 servings will fill you up alone. The Mie Aceh Stir-fry is delicious but not special because I have tried Mie Aceh which has a more pronounced taste and aroma of spices, but this is really enough for me who has a craving for warm, soupy and spicy food. Its just right, not too salty. Im really happy with my main goal, which is to work here and it happens to be quiet. Judging by the space is very intimate, I would call it, actually this is not an ideal place to work, especially for calls or meetings because the sound will leak to the surroundings, but it is really worth a visit Will be back to try Shawarma and Nasi Mandhi here. --- Santorini vibes but Middle Eastern flavors. I didnt intend to come here but when I passed by I was attracted to the front door so I went in, haha. A proof of thoughtful design, color or concept can make people take action ;) Just order Arayes and Americano, and be satisfied! Arayes are like pizza or martabak, thin and dry but taste like kebabs. Unfortunately, the sambae is not good enough. Yes, even though it looks like bottled chili sauce, there are things that taste better. Or maybe you can serve it with mayonnaise, tartar sauce, or other types of tamarind sauce so the taste is more balanced in the mouth. The Americano is delicious. My kinda type of black coffee; not sour, a little bitter, but the coffee tastes good. Love The table settings vary, not all of them are comfortable for eating or working on a laptop because there are tables that are knee high.

ChIJ-UKxieH1aS4R9vsbKaNnJp8,"I accidentally came across this restaurant because I wanted to entertain monks who were vegetarian. And it turns out the menu is DELICIOUS. No. Debate. The restaurants ambience is also comfortable, even though the room is not very spacious, you get the comfort. The waitresses were also friendly and helpful, explaining the menu patiently. Because not everyone understands vegetarian menus. Its a pleasure to eat here Service: 9/10 the waiter was friendly and the food came out quite quickly and was beautifully presented. Atmosphere: 8.5/10. The restaurant atmosphere is uniquely designed with beautiful green nuances that make you comfortable. Food: 8.5/10 Vegan Rendang Platter: 8.5/10 menu for Bhikkhu. And he said it was very delicious. Western Platter : 8/10. Its delicious but its just ordinary fried food which is similar to the meat version. Crispy chicken burger : 8.5/10. Its quite delicious. Okay for children who cant eat rice. Beefless lasagna : 8/10. Not too creamy with authentic tomato sauce. Good. Truffle Mushroom pasta : 8/10. Its delicious but unfortunately the truffle taste is lacking. Maybe you can add more to make it even better. Burgreen beefless steak: 8.5/10. This is my son eating. And this is delicious, said my son who loves steak. Vegan rendang bowl: 8.5/10 according to those who eat well. It fits his tongue. Excellent. Vegan Rica meat: 9.5/10. I forgot what the name of the menu is, but this is really delicious... The Rica red chili sauce stir-fried with the meat is really delicious. Those who want to go there must try this menu. Very suitable for the tongue of Indonesian people like me. Matcha Latte bobba: 8/10 delicious and fresh. The matcha tastes good Brother Max Boba Iced Milk Coffee: 8/10. The coffee is delicious on a friendly stomach. Brown sugar milky Boba: 8/10 not too milky because they use soy milk but its delicious. My son likes it. Raw strawberry cheesecake : 8.5/10. Delicious... Fresh asem2, tastes like real cheesecake. Kids friendly... So its really safe to bring your kids here, there are lots of menus that kids can eat. Kid-friendliness: The place is comfortable for eating with children. Its very good to bring your children here, for children who rarely eat plant based food you can come here because here the plants are transformed into something they will definitely like.

Many of the foods are not ready. When I ordered, it was like the cashier was guessing about the menu. Want to order Nasi A, apparently its not ready. It was explained that there was only BCDE rice. Then I wanted noodle soup with egg, but I didnt have any. It was explained that there was only a dimsum menu, and even then only a few were ready stock. But I dont want dim sum anymore. Skip. Then I asked again, is there toast? There arent any either. Are there French fries? There arent any either. Then he explained that the only thing available was burgers, cireng and bananas. Finally ordered cireng. With that price, my expectations are quite high for the qty of cireng that will be served. Oh my God, it turns out the portion is so small :( Yes, basically Im sorry. The name is also a review hehe Then in terms of facilities. The number of seats is too few.

There are also toilets and prayer rooms here. Parking is decent~ The good thing is, the service here is fast. Dont wait long.

Here there are various variants of cheesecake and also a drink menu. I tried several menus 1. New York Cheesecake (37,000), I think this is really delicious. The texture is soft with a dominant cheese taste, complemented by a separate strawberry sauce. It tastes really cheesy but delicious, doesnt make you tired and really goes well with the thick and fresh sour strawberry sauce. Recommended! 2. Mix Nutella (38,000), if you dont want too much cheese, you can try this menu. The taste is more dominant with nutella chocolate, the sweet type but the sweetness is still just right and there is a slight salty taste because there is a layer of cheese too. 3. Hot Latte, the coffee is quite strong and dominantly bitter. You can add sugar if you want it sweeter. 4. Iced Matcha Latte, I think its delicious because the texture is quite creamy and the matcha still has a bitter taste, a little milky with a sweet taste thats not excessive.

ChIJb9AgwhtXei4RXigcsC4eEeY,"My credentials as a food critic are simply decades of eating at every level of restaurants in Los Angeles.  Everything from $1 chili dogs to $60 steaks. This is not to compare with them but to give my honest opinion of the offerings at Opera. In the past week we have eaten at Opera three times.  Twice for dinner, once breakfast. Each meal will get a brief critique and rating, 10 being food heaven, 1...forget about it. Big Breakfast Described on the menu served with an omelette.  Instead the eggs, dead center on the plate, came undercooked sunnyside up, soaking the surrounding item with mucus like egg whites.  Later I saw a photo of the meal showing sunnyside eggs, not an omelette.  The accompanying sausage were two small, taste lacking, hot dogs.  The potatoes and salad were good. Score...2 Eggs  Florentine Very nice dish.  The eggs were perfectly boiled, resting on toast with a very good avocado spread, similar to guacamole. Score...8 Meltique Ribeye Teriyaki I have absolutely no idea what the meat is on this dish.  It looked nothing similar to the great photo they have posted.  It seemed to be some form of beef that had been pulverized and reconstructed.  It did not have a steak like texture and looked like reformed Spam.  I ordered it with spaghetti as a choice  was offered, rice being the other option.  It got delivered with rice.  I sent it back for correction.  The spaghetti in a mushroom sauce is unremarkable. Score...1 My wife had the barumundi fish entree twice.  Each time the meal was different. We also ordered the fried mushrooms, both times different in quantity and taste. These inconsistencies can result in the downfall of any business. My friends sandwhich order never got noted.  He had to reorder after everyone else was served. Opera offers a wonderful selection of delicious pastries.  This is their forte.  The cheese cake is excellent, when fresh. Cinnamon rolls delicious, just to note a couple. Update on pastry. It is stored in open air displays.  The heat and humidity will destroy them rapidly. My friends cheese cake was awful. Old, dried out. Ambiance is okay.  All meals were eaten in the front AC room.  We prereserved  a table for five, as they do not have much seating in this area.  Our table was waiting upon arrival with a personalized reserved sign on it.  Nice touch! Service is you all too commonly found Indonesian method.  Take the order, deliver the order.  Only return when hailed.  Otherwise, youre on your own. Recommendations Deliver meals that resemble the photos. Wait staff be attentive. Stop serving that steak I ordered. Serve all meals warm at the same time.  Ours came one about every five to ten minutes. Overall score...7 Out of the five in our group, three enjoyed their entrees.  Two vowed not to return for food but would for pastries/coffee.  All agreed that for the price there are better offerings at other restaurants. As mentioned this is only MY opinion.  No two experience anything alike.  I recommend trying Opera, most likely you will enjoy it. Update!  In response to your response. No one asked how I want the eggs. The Meltique Ribeye looked absolutely nothing like the photo on your site and when I showed it to the waitress asking for that meal was assured I was ordering that meal, not what I got...If that is waygu, I was not at all impressed. My wifes barumundi meal one night was encircled with mixed vegetables, last night it was totally different. These substitutions are a serious problem for a restaurant.  I can guarantee most patrons want what they see, that is why they order specific items.  Perhaps it was a mistake for us to have looked at the photos posted on your website before we came, after all, they were what stimulated us to come. Sorry, but highly doubt after three visits within one week that we will return for a meal.  We will return for pastries and coffee, but will not take the risk of having problems that seem to be ongoing.

Why wasnt I informed from the start that the nutritionist wasnt there when I made the appointment? For the problem that the nutritionist has gone home, why not follow up with another consultation according to the package I took? Is it because the price of the promo package for new patients is cheap, so they are treated arbitrarily? Why does the receptionist just arbitrarily decide something different from the doctor?

ChIJO_Utm3lZei4RUSxY844svLI,"Hello Brother, owner of Angkringan Tajzu, here I will review it as honestly as possible. So on Sunday night, January 15 2022, around 8pm, my 3 friends and I went to look for dinner and we ended up at Angkringan Tajzu. There I and 3 of my friends got poor service. First, when I was choosing food, the lady in the middle was either braiding or tying the hair of the cashier, who was at the very end. Yes, personally I dont like it a bit, when the lady is on duty but doesnt pay attention to buyers like that. For example, explaining what kind of food there is, etc. Yes, as a form of intention to sell. Second. After I chose the food I wanted, at the cashier the lady was very friendly towards the buyers. Please also give change politely. Its true that the money wasnt thrown, but when Ms. gave him change it was like he slammed it on the table. The tone of speech has also been softened a bit, sis. Third. Miss in the middle, please dont be rude to buyers. Its a shame that the service is like that. Fourth. My friend experienced this incident and immediately told me about it when we were eating there. So 3 of my friends and I ordered food in pairs. Me and 1 of my friends went first, then 2 of my friends next. Well, my friend, lets say A, ordered 2 sweet iced teas (meant for A and my other friend B). Person A pays for food and sweet iced tea 1 (her own order). So, Ms. Cashier, when Ms. A was putting her food on our table, said my friend, Ms. B, the cashier said How about it, Sis, order 2 drinks and only pay for 1 right in front of Ms. B. Yes, Ms. B said that. Maam, thats one more for me. The point is, dont immediately judge buyers like that, because if we eat at the table there, we also have to pay for what we eat, right? The food is delicious, the place is also comfortable. Yesterday I bought Rica chicken rice and it tasted delicious. The spices are delicious, the portions are sufficient and the prices are affordable. And other foods such as meatball satay, chicken satay, cireng, fried meatball satay etc. are also delicious. As for the food, everything is delicious. Only the service is really lacking in my opinion. The ladies are still young too, they look like theyre in their 20s, but theyre just bitchy. Its a shame, the food is delicious and lots of choices, the place is comfortable, but unfortunately the service from the ladies is very lacking (in my opinion).

For the brown sauce steak, its still delicious as usual, its just filled with flour, the meat is a finger deep, so its like a floured steak hahaha. This time I was really disappointed with the taste even though usually all the dishes are delicious, when I paid for the meal for two the price was 290 thousand for the menu of steak, nasgor, kale, shrimp and 2 iced teas, actually if it tasted like before I would have been fine with it    but this really doesnt taste good in the mouth or pocket , looks like the chef has changed, it really doesnt taste that good, the same as street food nasgor which costs 15k and its still better",1,"{""latitude"": -7.7281124, ""longitude"": 109.0116771}",Restoran

In my opinion, the fish tastes very good, fresh and delicious. The serving is served with a choice of shrimp paste chili sauce or onion chili sauce as well as basil, cucumber and tomato salad. The chili paste is coarsely ground, and I think the taste of the chili paste is really delicious. Unfortunately, I was a bit surprised when I paid that it wasnt cheap like in other reviews on Google. 1 Grilled Pomfret Fish is priced at 60,000 for the conditions in the stall and is located in the Java area (Yogyakarta), in my opinion it is quite expensive.

The money is not much, only 6 thousand, but please be polite in serving, Miss and Mas, they dont smile at all, I hope that when they are tired, they smile, customers waiting for a long time is usually not a problem, but if they are not friendly, thats what makes them lazy again. .

ChIJo2OuOGSpei4RYQ7JDIdvQwU,"In Banjarnegara itself, of course, it is still rare to find cafes this aesthetic. For the room, we were treated to all white paint. The layout of the room is very neat and very detailed. The cables in the cashiers room are very neatly arranged for me, which is a plus which is very rarely found in other cafes. As for the menu in the snack section, I also like it, he explained that if you order cireng, for example, it contains 4, mendoan contains 5, for example, something like that. Thats really good, so those of us who want to order it wont be confused about how much this snack contains, right? As for the menu, I ordered the one in the picture and the taste exceeded my expectations. The seasoning for the fried and grilled chicken really penetrated the chicken perfectly, theres no such thing as tough meat either. The sauce is also delicious, but sorry if you like it spicy, dont expect more. Maybe this is the problem. Recommendation so that everyone can taste the ayam penyet from parents, young people, children from the age of 10 can also eat it. The recommendation is that if you like coffee, you can order V60 Robusta, the coffee is delicious even if you mix it with ice, sometimes if you mix it with ice it actually tastes bland, but not this one, the bitterness is strong, especially if you have left a little of it, the original beeh is delicious. I also ordered squeezed orange ice, it wasnt sweet, it wasnt sour either, it was just fresh. For the employees, they are super friendly, 10 stars if there are any, every time they deliver food they are asked if there is enough or not, they are really friendly. Come here at night so the lights are really good. There is a bathroom, prayer room, sink, there is an aesthetic mirror too, there is an upstairs, special chairs for children. The facilities are complete, nice, aesthetic, comfortable, cool too because the place is also on the edge of the rice fields. Recommended for gatherings with friends, family/couple. The downside is that I also ordered melted bananas, the skin was thick so it was difficult to cut, the nails also used quite a lot of effort, haha. But I was still satisfied because the chocolate really melted in my mouth. But I still have to improve it The price of food/drinks is cheap because you get a nice place, friendly service and you should be really satisfied.

ChIJQajwaSz1aS4RcAc--ZoYeBk,"Actually, this low star is not for the seller in Alun Alunnya, but rather for the manager of Alun Alun Oak Food Station. In fact, this food court could be a selling attraction for customers who buy apartments behind the food court, but this place is NOT ATTENTIONAL at all. I am not a seller or have a tenant there, but an honest review of visitors/buyers. In fact, one of the reasons why I wanted to buy a unit at Oak was because of this food court. In my heart at that time... Its also nice that theres a food court downstairs, if youre too lazy to cook, you can just go downstairs. But the result is BIG ZERO. There are increasingly fewer visitors here, sometimes its a pity to see those who trade, all they do is play on their cell phones all day. Their stories say they only get 100-200 thousand/week, while the rental price is expensive. Please managers read all peoples reviews. Pay attention to the traders there, the rental price should not be too expensive, check whether the market is busy or quiet. Promote on social media, make live music, clean the food court which is really dirty full of leaf litter, dust, rats etc. Even though there was delicious food there in the past. There is Stickusteak which sells delicious steaks and my favorite drink SARSAPARILLA, Aceh noodles, fried rice in the corner, Korean style ice cream, typical Medan food. Everything is there... and the price in my opinion is still affordable. And now there are only 2-3 tenants left. Sad! The management must really take this seriously, must be able to bring Alun Alun Oak to the way it used to be, let all of Jakarta, especially North and East Jakarta, know that you have a cool place to hang out. If you dont clean it up, believe me... its just a matter of days before all the tenants will leave and Alun Alun will only remain in name. There is no longer the attraction of the apartment behind and the next apartment will be rebuilt. Thats all-",1,"{""latitude"": -6.1800296, ""longitude"": 106.9046039}",Restoran

Please improve the service, add more employees or menu as much as possible, dont have too many menus but be overwhelmed with cooking.

Its a trivial matter, but it cant be taken lightly either This afternoon I came here and I accidentally spilled my own drink which automatically spilled drinking water onto the floor (where I was lying on the floor), even though the water only spilled a little. I asked the boss who was delivering my drink for a nap, but the boss didnt respond, didnt know what to hear, so that was it. Well, followed by my friend who just came, he automatically ordered and a menu was delivered to where my friend and I were, coincidentally the one who brought it was different from the one who delivered my drink earlier. I tried to tell the boss to ask for a rag Sir, can I have a rag? (While pointing at the water on the floor of the floor) Thank God, bro, there was a response, Oh yes, just a moment, Sis. I waited, it took a long time, and suddenly the two of them (the one who delivered my order and the one my friend had) came to us, delivering another menu from another friend of mine too, maybe the other guy was looking for another customer whose order he brought. I hope the bro brings a rag, hehe, especially since the two of them came (I asked both of them to help bring a rag). Hey, in fact, they didnt bring a rag at all, even though they looked at me, we looked at them as if I were looking, Wheres the rag, sir? :( But the darling doesnt seem to notice, did you forget? In the past, I also asked the boss who delivered my order for a rag, and then he came again with a rag. In the future, hopefully we can pay more attention and listen to what customers say.

It took a really long time for the food to arrive, more than 1.5 hours. Its been a long wait but to be fair, its okay, Ive been waiting a long time but the buyers who came after us were given priority, so whats the point of writing on the note? Thats it, what was cooked and what was ordered was wrong too. have to wait a long time. Its surprising, there are also some feelings from the employees. ordered nasgor, it just tasted ordinary, nothing special. 36 thousand spent, 50 thousand in cash, given 4 thousand back. pie to iki. Thats when I was already walking. I wouldnt recommend coming back to eat here, the wait is really long.

Here are the lists of drinks I ordered: -  Cappuccino 1.5/5 : I usually still pretty generous in giving out reviews for coffee but this one is not drinkable. There was no one in the coffee shop, I was the only customer.. and I had to wait 20 minutes for a single cappuccino. I was like okay fine, this better be good. Um turns out, the barista put too much milk & the temperature was super super hot and tasted super bad. -  hot chocolate 2/5 slighty better only waited for 5 minutes for this. But it was just chocolate nothing special. They said that they use dark chocolate but it literally tasted like chocolate sachet -  Croissant 2.5/5 kinda taste like it s yesterday s croissant I wouldn t review extreme bad reviews if the staff would at least apologies or says thank you when I gave them feedback. But when I told the barista, he kinda shows that he disagree and didn t care about my feedback at all. Well, I expected better service. Atmosphere and the place itself is super cute, it saddens me if this keep on going.. afraid other customers will experience the same thing.",1,"{""latitude"": -7.277096299999999, ""longitude"": 112.73939279999999}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

We dined in November 2023 and we still talk about how horrid the onion rings were up till today whenever we see onion rings in any menu. This is a self serve cafe. You need to scan a QR code to order and then pick up the coffee from the counter. Food: We ordered some coffee, nasi sambal ijo, onion rings. The coffees were ok (3.5/5) Nasi was ok (3.5/5) Onion rings (-10/5). Yes, that is a negative. They were extremely hard to bite into and not chewable. Our jaws hurt just trying to eat them. They were most definitely re-fried. We sent it back and the server gave us another bowl that had exactly the same texture. Atmosphere: Outside was attractive. Inside, wasn t hygienic. There were big flies everywhere. They landed on our food and drinks. A small fly trapping device was placed in a corner but no flies went there. Sofa was dirty. Suggestion: Please monitor the food quality Train the food handlers. They don t appear to be experienced. Reevaluate your garbage disposal protocol. Nearby shops didn t seem to have this fly problem. Get a proper flytrap Do something guys.

When I went to the Museum, I placed an order for takeout a regular-sized Yugo Bowl with salad (an upsized), which the staff indicated would be great because it would mean more veggies and toppings. However, it turned out to be upsetting because they dont seem to care what you actually order, thus I discovered my bowl to be completely filled with rice rather than a bowl of salad to go with the toppings. Of course I immediately called and was initially relieved as the staff promised to send a replacement bowl to my address immediately. Three hours had passed since 4pm. By 7pm, the promised bowl had not arrived. Are they lying to me? Did they really send it? Or was it not sent by instant courier? Its not cooked food, and it has to be fresh.

Suddenly the name of this coffee appeared and we finally decided to accept the challenge of going up here... As a result we arrived at our destination... we werent sure about the map we were using but we still pushed up  . The right place at the wrong time in my opinion, because I arrived here at 8 pm, so the view really couldnt be seen because it was really dark the whole way up. Maybe in the afternoon I can enjoy the atmosphere here more, okay? But all of our journey was satisfied when we arrived here... the food was delicious, especially the fried banana... the rice bowl was delicious, the fried chicken was also delicious. The espresso was just as expected Plus the place is cool, comfortable, not stuffy... its really good for refreshing the brain... The service is also friendly. My advice is if you want to come here in the afternoon so you can really see the view... And dont forget that the car must be in good condition because the climb is quite good... its not scary, you just need to be extra careful and have a high driving experience (no beginner) especially if you go up at night.

Service: Food takes a long time to arrive, drinks come later, while other restaurants have free takjil, here there isnt any. Minus points Food: ordered the Chicken Katsu Carbonara, when it arrived it was already stiff, dry and not creamy at all, the katsu was a bit hard, the smoked beef was like asking for it, the taste was still good with the parmes cheese even though I was already bored from the moment it arrived. Drinks: ordered Cold Tea Pot Gingerlime, bland, not sweet, not sour, served not using a Tea Pot but using a French press. The glasses are made of paper cups which are sluggish, not glass cups or glasses which are really used for drinking tea, like those that are free at mosques. BAD Price: for food & drinks, it costs 79k, which is far from worth it. Apart from the place, there is nothing that can be said to be okay. Or maybe its really hectic when breaking the fast, it happens like this, maybe if its slower it could be better.

Also the duck prosciutto, cos they said it was fresh. Do you slaughter the duck to order or why do even appetizers need 40 minutes? 2. I ordered sourdough and butter for an appetizer. The staff refused to give me a knife at first because I was only eating bread. When I tried to explain why I need a knife for the butter, they brought me a spoon. 3. If one has to wait almost an hour for their food, then please at least provide wifi. The sourdough here and the butter are still my favorite, but you need to remember theres LOTS of good bread in Malang and if this is the quality of the service you cant rely on good food alone to make sure people come back. Also, Im all for expats learning the local language, but the location being frequently visited by tourists, it might help to get English-speaking staff and not people who just say okay okay when they dont understand you. xxxxxxxxxxxxx Went for the croissant, stayed for the sourdough.

Only after that, the menu was brought out quickly *This cafe is beautiful and elegant. They have indoor and outdoor (more of a semi-outdoor I think). Their indoor ones are there for large groups too. *They have clean toilets. *Closed ablution area (only boys and girls together). *The prayer room is small, but they have lots of mukenas and they are clean Actually, this is the 3rd time Ive been to Jeeva, but this is the first time I can review it  . *Food review: Yesterday I ordered 3 menus, but here I can only review 2 menus. Because I didnt try the Betawi jeeva soto  . -Batak Gomak Noodles: MashaAllah, this is really delicious    . The sauce is a bit thick, but delicious. Even though its red, its not spicy. However, it turns out that this menu must use stick noodles. And in my opinion, these noodle sticks are big, easy to break but not chewy. But the taste is really delicious 8.8/10 -Wagyu Crazy Rice: The wagyu is really delicious (but wagyu must be delicious anyway   ). 8.3/10 *The point is that all menus are cooked with a sincere heart  .

About 10 minutes of waiting at my table, a group of people came, then they were already looking at my seat, and it wasnt long before one of the waitresses came to me and asked, Brother, can you move to the bar table for one person? Because they wanted to use the table, they were busy. Even though the situation next to me was the same, 2 people were using a table for 4 people. But because the tables are individual, they can be separated or combined. I automatically just looked at the waitress who was speechless because I was in shock for the first time experiencing something like this. After getting my reaction, which already made my face uncomfortable, the waitress thought, she asked the person next door to borrow a separate table, so I moved there so that the table I was at earlier could be shared with the people who had just arrived earlier. The food is delicious but in my opinion its useless if the service for dine-in is like that! Ive already done it, Ive paid and Ive been treated like that?

Regarding breakfast provisions from what time to what time, where is it located. 2. What facilities are available? 3. If we need help, we have to know where to go, right? There are several types of resort buildings, so if every customer needs something to cook, they have to go to the FO which is quite far away. FYI there is no telephone provided in the room.

Im a big fan of thai food, Tapi trnyata jauh bgt dr ekspektasi... i ordered 2 meals and 1 beverage, honest opinion : Thai tea 1/10 hambar bgt asli gaada rasa thai tea nya samsek , padahal its a thai cafe , thai tea is an essential. (Im a big fan of thai tea, i tried a lot of thai tea bahkan juga i made it by myself , dan it tastes much much much better than this.)the color is pale dan bahkan rasa manispun gaada..  *circle ks thai tea tastes better than this. I mean come on , im so disappointed. Honey sriracha chicken 5/10, ya so so. Nothing special. Pad thai 4/10. Pad thai not supposed to be becek terlalu asam rasanya.. it supposed to taste like pad thai but its not.

Deliberately went to Matraman hoping to be as comfortable as white cempaka and indeed wanted caramel coffee as well as a snack to break the fast. It turned out that the first time you entered it was already uncomfortable, on the right side in front of the cashier there were sitting around, either visitors/employees lying down at 4 in the afternoon or maybe 4-6 people actually sleeping. , I dont think its appropriate for a cafe carving to sleep lying on a bench against the wall, because it looks dirty, the girls and boys are combined into one lying on the chairs, even though the room is AC but the guys are smoking, Im really annoyed. Finally, those who wanted to go indoors had to go out because they couldnt bear the smell of cigarette smoke in the AC room. It turned out that outside the smell of cat pee was so strong that it would move to any bench, the table was not well looked after, so how could it be cleaned so that the smell of cat pee didnt stink sob. And the jacket had ten feathers falling from the tree, sob (luckily I was wearing a jacket). But for food, I recommend it and like the Chicken wings, they are delicious, the spaghetti is delicious, unfortunately the coffee is a misperception. I was told that I wanted caramel and a topping like white cempaka, but I was directed to machiato. Even though I deliberately went there to get the caramek coffee. But never mind, just wrap it up and enjoy it without complaining. I just thought the atmosphere wasnt like the one in Cempaka Putih.

Ordering capjay also doesnt taste like the typical capjay that we often encounter in the surrounding Karanganyar area, (sorry, but the capcay sauce tastes like steak sauce) For hot tea, Teh Tarik is delicious",1,"{""latitude"": -7.6063287, ""longitude"": 110.94869299999999}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

Yesterdays lack of service, I had time to clean the table, spray it and go to the lab, but maybe because I used a cloth that was already dirty and still wet, it actually made the table smell bad, making it uncomfortable. The distance between the tables is too close, so its less comfortable if the positions are full because theyre too close together to chat. The most important thing is food, order 1. Red fried rice, the standard portion is not tasty enough 2. The ponti egg rice, the sauce is not enough and the rice is sticky but the fried rice is just ordinary, the taste is also not tasty enough 3. The watery orange ice is not worth the price 4. Honey lemon ice, the taste and price is not worth it Hopefully it will be better in the future",1,"{""latitude"": -7.8011037, ""longitude"": 110.3505814}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

However, for cafes in tourist attractions, many consumers come in groups and sometimes dont understand what the cafe menu is plus they are still confused about what to order. So in the future, at least photocopy the menu so there are lots of them, provide pens and notes so consumers can write down their orders themselves. I came at lunch time.. Buseet, there was a really big queue at the cashier and it turned out that the reason for the queue was that there were customers who were taking a really long time to order what they wanted to order because it was a big group + it was their first time there so just stood there until they were fixed on what they wanted to order.. Like that, not just one or two but a lot. The queue at the back was like a Pertalite queue. Thats all my advice.. Photocopy of menu + pen + notes..

I arrived at the place at half past one, the first food didnt come out until about an hour, and the first drink didnt come out until about half an hour. And even then, drink FLAWLESS ICE TEA, friends.   The distance between one food and another is many times the time. Then my aunt ordered an iced drink (I already ordered it when I made the reservation), only to be told that the iced drink was empty after waiting for about 2 hours.   Ive already avoided it. After that it was replaced with coconut ice, but its been a long wait. And what I saw was that the serving was not finished at one table first, but it was as if the chef liked whichever one was served first. The funny thing is, at the Joglo there were about 3 families eating there, and we looked at each other and felt bad because the service was bad.   My big family and I have been waiting until half past 4, almost 4, finally decided to go home. Is all the food out? Oh of course not, mate. There are still 2 or 3 menus that havent come out yet. I also ordered pizza, which pizza takes up to 2 and a half hours to cook?????? Maybe in the future the workflow can be improved.

ChIJUQyDGr1Xei4RO5dXFv3bepE,"After all the hype I heard from my friends about this place, finally I got to try on my recent visit to Yogya. First, I really was surprised with the pricing for all the food presented on the menu, despite hearing those claims already from my friends. There is no where else that I know of that has prices as affordable! Carpaccio, Escargot, Steak, Pasta. These all could be found in the range of 50k - 150k.  Insane! I was really happy with the authenticity of the establishment as well. We came as a group as we ordered a whole bunch of food. The menu was really alluring. When the food came, it was really HUGE PORTION. Most of the menu, the group really enjoyed them. We ordered the soup, pizza, the steak, the appetizer tuna, king prawn special of the day, Seafood pasta, the Duck with potato gratin. Personally, the food were just mostly okay for me. It didnt quite leave any lasting impression for a revisit. Some menu were too salty (potato gratin, king prawn), and the juices were way too diluted. The one that tasted better is probably the Duck. My least favorite is probably the Seafood pasta, it has some artificial taste somehow. My other guess is probably the kitchen was really busy, because its almost full house when we got there, could probably be reason the food isnt as good as the hype for me.",1,"{""latitude"": -7.818566, ""longitude"": 110.36452759999999}",Restoran

This place is famous for its fried chicken menu. At the end of 2023, you can get a promo every time you make any purchase at this KFC store. The promotion will be visible on your purchase receipt. 1. KFC Crispy Burger --> The appearance is quite attractive according to the price. The combination of the flavors of the bread and the filling is perfect, the crispy meat lives up to its name. Equipped with chopped mustard greens, garlic, tomato sauce and mayonnaise 2. Cream Puff --> A type of long bread shaped like churros with a bread outside and cream inside. The taste doesnt fit and doesnt blend together (not recommended) 3. KFC Pudding --> Instant pudding placed in the refrigerator, the taste is good but the chocolate is not sweet enough, the texture and softness are suitable. Unfortunately the packaging smells bad. 4. Scramble Egg --> Smells and looks like regular scrambled eggs. The taste is slightly pronounced and the texture is slightly fluffy. Vegetarian options: On the vegetarian menu, you can choose a small menu such as snack pudding, cream puffs, or other non-vegetable dishes. Dietary restrictions: Dietary restrictions are not recommended because this is a fast food restaurant that does not support diet programs. Foods high in carbohydrates and sugar. Parking: The parking lot is located right in front of the KFC Diponegoro Ungaran store which can accommodate more than 10 two-wheeled vehicles and several four-wheeled vehicles. Kid-friendliness: This place is suitable for children because it tastes right in childrens mouths, there is a kids menu, so you can hold birthday celebrations for children.

The second time, finally tried it straight away and the vibes were cool and cool. It seems like its still new and Ill be coming here often, haha, because Ive never seen a cafe in that area before.

Because the dominant color is neutral, it makes it great for photos using any camera . I just didnt try to taste the heavy food, but the snacks are also delicious with mini, adorable portions. Thats great, its really great . Whats different from other cafes is that you dont have to pay for parking when youre done, eits, but just be careful, bro, even though theres CCTV, we have to remain responsible for the vehicles you drive, theres also a confession spot ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha .

ChIJX9CUizqNaS4R--M2k-7VbC0,"Overall: 1/5 For those who want to come here, you should think twice. Otherwise, you can hit the jackpot  : ill-mannered passive-aggressive barrista. _ Service-Hospitality: 1/5 (if you can give 0.5, Ill give 0.5) When we arrived (Saturday, March 23 24 - 17.00), there were 2 barristas on standby: 1 man & 1 woman. The most problematic: the manners of the female barrista. First, the payment receipt was not provided by the person. to buyers. Then, because our order was quite large (2 packages of ONE + 1 dim sum), I asked if the tray could be borrowed (and would be returned immediately after placing the order on the table). But yes. CM answered, Nothing!, curtly. Even though at that time there was a tray on the cashiers counter carried by a male barrista. I dont have a problem with the self-service system, but trays should be provided so that buyers can carry large orders easily to their table. Apart from that, the SOP for opening and closing the cashier counter window for orders from the outdoor area is also quite annoying because of the barrista. opening and closing the sliding window with a loud stomp - I see in the review column there are already people complaining about this too. My friend & I were still standing in front of the cashiers counter to place an order, but yes. had closed the sliding window with a loud smack. Is it because of the barristas bad manners, or because of technical problems/the design of the window which is really hard when opening and closing? What is clear is that it gives the impression of being unfriendly and unprofessional. My friend & I immediately thought, I want to order a lot. The window has been opened, but its closed again. The desire to order disappeared instantly because of that. In my experience in designing F&B facilities (which are much higher-end than Kaneki), the walk thru ordering counter (outdoor ordering access) is always open, not opened and closed. To be consistent, it might as well be closed and you can only order from inside the room. My friend & I came in the afternoon at PKL. 17.00. Initially we sat in the outdoor area, at a corner table near the speakers, where the music was played at a standard volume so it didnt disturb our chatting activities too much. But now at street time. 19.30 I dont know why the speaker volume was turned up and it became quite annoying. Me & 2 of my friends thought, it wasnt us who were disturbed; This is the central area of the comp. residential area and its already night, but the sound of music is even louder, which in fact can disturb the peace of the local residents too. Then my friend took the initiative to go to the cashier counter, asking the barrista. so that the music volume is reduced to normal. After that the music volume was turned down, but only for a moment. When my friend returned to his seat, the music volume turned up again. Very unprofessional. Finally we decided to move to another table in Bag. front, near the entrance. But what was even more annoying was, after we moved tables, the music volume was turned down again. The barristas minus behavior. dont stop there. Around 10 p.m. 21.15, me & 2 of my friends are still chatting at the new table where we moved. Ybs. suddenly approached our table, saying that the cafe would close at midnight. 21.30. But strangely, it was only our table that was approached & warned by the person, while no one was approached and warned by the other tables like our table. As if you trying to evict us all at once   and thats what hes done. since the speaker volume is turned up at street level. 19.30. _ Atmosphere-Facilities: 2/5 The indoor area is small with soundproof glass walls, so conversation sounds can be clearly heard because they echo (sound reflects off the glass walls). For a more private spot, you have to go outdoors, but that too with a music volume that is too big. _ Food Price: 2/5 A bit overpriced for a small cafe in the middle of the compound. housing (not on the side of a major road). Food portions are relatively small compared to the price; the taste is also normal; coupled with the barristas very negative behavior. Not worth trying. _ Updates: After reading again, apparently there are a lot of reviews here that complain about the bad behavior of female barristas - and it seems like they are referring to the same barrista because of the same pattern of bad behavior. But it seems like the owner has no intention of responding to these complaints. Those reviews. not responded to with an explanation & apology, and apparently the barrista who had the problem was not/hasnt been replaced by the owner/management.",1,"{""latitude"": -6.239963299999999, ""longitude"": 106.9362956}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

ChIJWz2aJ3UfcS4RuJNeHD1NSGU,"Located in Jepara, precisely in the Pengkol area. Very close to Jepara city center. The concept of this coffee shop is good and very young and also aesthetic. The parking area is large so it is very easy to get in and out of vehicles. There is space for live music performances too, which seems to be only on weekends. For venues, there are 2 choices, outdoor and indoor. The outdoor area is also very spacious and there is a rooftop option. Even indoors is quite spacious. There is a prayer room and toilet too. But all of this is not balanced by the cleanliness of the place, which in my opinion is lacking and even looks poorly maintained, especially the indoor area and rooftop. The stairs to the rooftop are also dangerous, especially during the rainy season. What is most surprising is the time for making food and drinks. Long time. My order wasnt finished for more than an hour even though at that time only my group was there and the menu I ordered was the standard menu. Thanks to Ms. Kamila who was able to at least somewhat cure my disappointment with good service. As for the taste of the food and drinks, its delicious and recommended, but the time it takes to make the food is very long",1,"{""latitude"": -6.5881994, ""longitude"": 110.67682409999999}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

As for the area, there is an indoor area on the 1st floor and an outdoor area in the backyard. Meanwhile, the 2nd floor area is more specifically used as a working space, so students or employees who want to enjoy WFC in the coffee shop can use this area. Apart from that, the most interesting part is the bar table which uses a modern modular bar concept which is still rarely found in coffee shops. For a fairly complete menu, I ordered a hot cappuccino and a hot cafe latte, both taste similar, light but creamy and have a delicious sweet fruity sensation.

But if there is a promotion or discount (depending on the promotion) it can be cheaper but it can also still be more pricey In terms of merchandise collections, there is one advantage compared to similar competitors, namely that there are several imported items that are not available in other competitors. Even though its not exclusively sold only in food halls. For other items, normal like other general merchandise In terms of space, you could say its quite spacious for a minimarket. Just like competitors who usually use 2 stalls for trading As for service, it depends on the employees because some are friendly but there are also ordinary ones For those using cars, you can park for a while in front of the food hall. But if you use a motorbike, sometimes you can park it in an online motorbike taxi, but sometimes you have to park it in the motorbike basement which is far from the location.

The place looks neglected, the bathroom floor is very slippery, be careful if you bring small children. Those who say this place is cool, Im sure they often get hot. Ha ha ha. The food is delicious, but the way it is prepared means that the fried fish, which should be able to be enjoyed for meat, becomes very small. And the price is EXPENSIVE in my opinion for city people. Remote place although it can be found via Maps. According to the child, he wanted to fish, rented a fishing pole for 5,000 but there was no bait. I didnt catch any fish for more than two hours. It doesnt look like there are any fish. One more thing, if you order food at this place, the price does not match the menu. Later, the chili sauce and fresh vegetables will be charged again, and that is not included in the menu list. Meanwhile, the menu list only includes gourami, tilapia, pomfret fish, which can be fried, grilled, grilled with honey, sweet and sour. Also white rice, sweet tea. If it is not listed there and served, you have to pay again.

We also asked the officer why we were on the terrace, the answer was that the terrace is also indoor. Then we asked again, According to her, do you think if you sit on the terrace, whether its outside or inside? he answered himself outside. If we respond, it means it doesnt match our request. and answered again with the template. At the start of the reservation, WA chat asks for a list of orders with 2 files, the bukber package and the regular menu. and asked for dp. When we received the deposit and sent the order, we were told that regular menu orders would only be processed at 7pm at the earliest. Logically, we order it to eat and eat at the same time as bukber. If it doesnt work, why is the regular menu included or why wasnt it announced earlier? the admin answered again according to the template. When we arrived the food was already served. We asked why the food had already been served even though the customer hadnt arrived yet, the worker who delivered it answered its like that here. Because our place was full so we just delivered it straight away - REALLY THIS WAS A hadeh ANSWER. Our extended family is also an FnB actor in a big city, we often eat at various restaurants where we order in advance, but NEVER ONE of the food is brought out before (at least) 1 representative of the customer who ordered has arrived. whats the reason like that? When I paid at the cashier, it turned out there were lots of people complaining too. there are those who have made a reservation but the menu doesnt come out, there are those who have made a reservation but its wrong and theyve complained that it wont be replaced immediately, etc. and the admins answer is the same: if its not appropriate from the start, you can cancel and the deposit will be returned. pie, how come the solution is like that? where every time we asked or complained to the officer, he didnt have a friendly face and his answers were curt. My family works in the hospitality sector, so we were surprised how come, we dared to open with a RESTO class title BUT the hospitality wasnt good. Oh yes, even the order we ordered was at that price, it seemed ordinary. the price for a package of bukber ribs is 60, but the meat is tough. The taste of the rujak seasoning is also like gule. the duck is also a lot. so its really not worth it. In other restaurants, ribs are the same price but they are tastier and more tender. so its worth it. The taste of iced tea is also inconsistent. I drank 3 glasses but the taste was all different. Even though the 2 were added after breaking the fast. The reasoning is that you can try it first if the worker is fasting. Is there really no consistent recipe here, I dont know.",1,"{""latitude"": -7.547223499999999, ""longitude"": 110.21938949999999}",Kafe dan Kedai Kopi

ChIJcV9VKIONei4RBaRSAEeQVJU,"Service is ok, waiters are quick to serve and orders come out quickly, but because this is a restaurant, the main selling point must of course be the food. We ordered papaya salad, pad Thai, fried chicken in Bangkok sauce, and brisket. Incidentally, the mango salad was sold out, so we chose the substitute Papaya salad in the hope that the taste would be close to the authentic taste. However, its disappointing because because it uses ripe papaya, it doesnt have the crunchy taste found in Thai salads, its not sour enough and doesnt seem to have any special spices like that. Rating 3/10 The Bangkok fried chicken is ok, rating 8/10. The Pad Thai, which is predicted to be a champion food, is no less disappointing. The texture is sticky, mushy, even the fried kwetiaw in Nasgor Tektek is still better. Rating 3/10 The brisket is tender, but a little salty, so you should eat it with a side dish. There is a choice of Texas or Thai Style, the only difference is the side dish. Texas with baked potatoes or French fries, while Thai style with Naan or rice. Rating 6/10. For drinks, I ordered kedondong juice, it tasted like it was mostly water, so it was just sugar + a little kedondong + water. Rating 3/10. Will I go back to this place? No. Would I recommend this place to others? No.",1,"{""latitude"": -7.6094384999999996, ""longitude"": 110.2090168}",Restoran

What used to be cash is now debit. Maybe this is soup, but we as Solo residents who uphold Solo peoples etiquette, it seems like we dont respect/insult us because we dont have money, even though our intention is to buy and pay. 3. While we were there, the menu was rarely complete and there were definitely drawbacks, this has been a period of 1 year without any improvements or evaluations, right?

Salah satu kata2 dari waiternya Kita mesti tau dulu siapa yg mesen dan apa kepentingannya. Lah kepentingannya saya mau makan, urusan customer dateng puasa atau engga juga bukan urusan kalian. Harusnya waiter bisa ngerti buat melakukan service yg baik dan benar. Saya bolak balik mesti ngechat admin IG, telfon dan segala macem hanya karna masalah miskom internal mereka. Karyawannya berasa songong banget, nanya stopkontak bukannya ditunjukkin langsung tapi malah customer suruh nyari sendiri. Mana stop kontak dibelakang sofa harus customer juga yang narik-narik sofanya. Untuk makanan dengan harga yg menurut saya cukup pricey dan masih kurang. Mie aceh oke lah, mie kocok masih oke, Spaghetti Bolognese masaknya setengah mateng, keras dan letis. Kita pesen paket takjil ternyata tambahannya cuma kurma doang. Itupun dateng paling akhir,  karna harus diingetin dulu ke waiternya kalo kita pesen paket buka puasa. Untuk tempatnya sendiri agak panas, dibagian depan cuma ada satu kipas aja jadi ya ga terlalu comfy banget lah. Mungkin kalo buat acara rame sampe 10 orangan bakal terasa pengapnya.

The favorite food here is chicken rice with sambal matah, the taste of the sambal matah is just right, not too much onion or lemongrass. The coffee is delicious at an affordable price. But I chose less sugar because I dont really like sweet hehe. BTW, they are also ready at Gofood & Grabfood, you know.

Price 45 thousand/person 2. The all you can eat system eats as much as you like but its strange that we cant request meat or chicken, so later the waiter will be given meat and chicken on a plate of approximately 100-150 grams for both of us, the contents are a mixture of meat and chicken... Even though all you can eat as much meat as you like, you cant just request meat.. they say the package is like that, its not possible even though its all you can eat.. Because I dont like chicken, I only asked once so I was disappointed.. 3. The usual all you can eat meat with sweet marinade is not suitable because the taste is more salty, there is black pepper and onion 4. And when I went there it was 17.45 -18. The 30 desserts only include delicious fried dumplings, delicious cuangki, so dont try it because its already watery, and delicious iced yogurt, for drinking lemon tea and delicious orange flavor. Its just that there arent any other variations like the reviews of other friends like theres porridge or sauce. 5. For Tomyan, I didnt try it because I dont like Tomyan. The contents were also the same, given 1 plate containing noodles, vermicelli, vegetables and two meatballs. BUT if you just want to refill frozen food, you cant say its already packaged...

You can choose a small hangout table if youre just drinking, or a sofa table, or a wooden table for the family. The location is on the ground level of the Novotel YIA, so those who are bored of the typical hotel restaurant atmosphere can really hang out here, especially if you like books and board games because here they provide quite a lot of books to read. Mostly romance & Mira W, but there is also Paulo Coelho, and architecture magazines, and... Sentaro & Hai Miiko comics. The reading choice is a bit absurd, I know, but I think this is a private collection that owns a cafe and I just enjoy looking at any book lol. For those who want to hang out while charging their gadgets, plugs are also available on all the tables attached to the wall. The service is okay, the staff are friendly too. Its a shame that many of the menus arent available, but maybe because I went there during Eid, there was beef at the market after being brushed by mothers to cook rendang, maybe. Buy me a special curry noodle which turns out to be, hmm, just Indomie with cheese added (I think). Its actually delicious, its not a problem, the curry is delicious and the sauce is creamy, the topping is boiled egg and fried onions, actually its not a problem because its for dinner, its not heavy either. With a price of 35k for the size of a hotel cafe it still comes in, we all know were not paying for the food only here. Unfortunately I didnt have time to try other dishes and cakes, maybe next time. He also provides several kinds of beer, and the funny thing is there is locally produced canned kombucha.

For the menus we ordered, there were Interjunet aka Indomie Corned Beef Cheese Egg, Crazy Fried Rice, Chicken Salted Egg, and Fried Kwetiau... ^^ The restaurant itself is quite spacious because it consists of two floors and we think the atmosphere is really comfortable for gathering with friends... On the first floor there is also a smoking room... ^^ The most exciting thing here is that its open until 2 am every day and there are also various board games available which will definitely make hanging out with friends even better...

I had to wait almost 10 minutes to order because there were no staff on duty at that time. Why can you leave the cashier counter empty when there are lots of people passing by? For a large cafe like PublicUs there must be at least 1 person standing guard at the front. This is different from other tenants such as Kalis, or several tenants on the 2nd floor, all of whom have at least 1 staff standing by behind their counter. 2. Serving food takes a long time. When you want to order food, there are only processed potatoes, even though its already far from opening hours, you should have prepared the ingredients. Actually, its not a big problem, really. The problem is why do you just order French fries and potato wedges and have to wait 30 minutes? Even though this process is easy and fast. Serving drinks is no problem, its good and fast.

ChIJZet2EkH3aS4RAZaaCqeoSm0,"SUPERGRAIN offers dishes with a selection of proteins and vegetables in a proportionate amount suitable for those trying to maintain a healthy diet. Other than that, they also offer various type of grain, such as black rice, basmati, furikake rice, and so on. The restaurant allows the customer to customize their meal by choosing from those wide array of grains, proteins, and vegetables. In my opinion, this customization option is one of their strength. Customers who are familiar with the dishes can order the foods according to their preferences, and for those feeling explorative can have the freedom to mix and match the dishes. They also offer a curated menu for those who does not want to think much about what combination is good. I ordered the skinny fish red curry with lychee. It is supposedly one of their customers favorite, and the combination also piqued my interest, as I never had the chance to eat a savory meal combined with lychee. Since I came on a weekday, they also had a promo, so I got a discount as long as I bought drinks. I chose their House Blend Iced Tea. Once the dish came, I have to admit that I was disappointed. The meal came with basmati rice (I believe), fish, cauliflower, broccoli, lychee, and few slices of pineapple (which surprised me) slathered (kind of) with red curry sauce. My first impression was that the meal did not look appetizing, although I think it was partially due to the haphazard plating. The portion was also on the smaller side, especially for the fish and vegetables. Most notably ,however, was the thinly slice of fish meat, I guess it lives up to its name as it is really barebone. I understand that the intention is food restaurant with consideration of nutrition balance and healthy diet, but I think for the price tag, they can give more of the side dishes. For the taste of the meal, it also confused me how the menu can be a favorite. The basmati rice each stand on their own, which I came to enjoy actually, but the curry sauce was more on the sour side. The fish was barely there, and the vegetables had quite a crunch. The cauliflower was noticeable since they were a bit sweet. What compelled me was the pineapple and even more so, the lychee. I am unable to comprehend on how to eat them, I can see that a pairing of sweet and sour can be delightful, but the pineapple had sweetness that overcame the currys sourness. The lychee, which has even more sweeter flavor, actually made my tongue recoil in confusion. I dont see how the sweetness of the fruit can complement the sourness of the dish since they ended up overwhelming the tastebud. Other than the meal, the iced tea is okay, not memorable for me to comment, but it is decent and the free refill can be quite nice. The place looks okay. It is inside a mall, so the air conditioning and cleanliness is top notch. The interior design reminded me of old-school or vintage American diner (not that Ive ever been there). Theres not much I can say about the place. All in all, it is regrettable for me to say that I did not enjoy the food, and I think it is a bit too pricey for the portion. I have certain fondness of plain healthy food, but even it did not help me to savor the meal. I think this place is recommended for those who wants healthy options with a customizable menu (and enough disposable income), which can be great for the customer to not get bored. For those who is interested to try it out, I think you have to make sure you understand the flavor profile, otherwise youll end up like me who was stuck with sour curry with sweetness overload of lychee and barebone fish.",1,"{""latitude"": -6.1763473, ""longitude"": 106.7910398}",Restoran
